PRACTICAL TASK:
  
  Your task will be to calcualte a user's total holiday cost, which includes the 
  plane cost, hotel cost, and car-rental cost.

  Firstly, get the following user inputs:
    - city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (You can create some
      options for them. Remember each city will have different flight
      costs.)

    - num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel.

    - rental_days: The number of days for which they will be hiring a car.

  Next, create the following four functions: 
    - hotel_cost: This function will take num_nights as an argument,
      and return a total cost for the hotel stay (you can choose the price
      per night charged at the hotel).

    - plant_cost: This function will take city_flight as an argument
      and return a cost for the flight. 

    - car_rental: This function will take rental_days as an argument 
      and return the total cost of the car rental (you can choose the daily
      rental cost.)

    - holiday_cost: This function wil take the three arguemnts 
      hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. Using these three 
      arguments, you can call all three of the above functions with
      respective arguments and finally return a total cost for your 
      holiday.

  Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable way.

# COMPLETED TASK
'''
1. Create a function (using keyword def) named hotel_cost and store num_nights in the parameters as the argument
    - Create a variable named price_per_night and store the price charged by the hotel
    - Return total cost by multiplying num_nights by price_per_night

2. Create another funtion named plane_cost with city_flight being the argument
    - Use if/elif/statements where if the user input matchets one of the cities listed a price will be returned
    - use else statement to return 0 if what user has entered does not match list

3. Create another function named car_rental with rental_days being the argument
    - Create a variable named daily_rental_cost and store price per day
    - return total cost by multiplying rental_days and daily_rental_cost

4. Create another function named holiday_cost with the arguments being hotel_cost, plane_cost, and car_rental
    - Create a total cost by adding the three previous functions together
    - Return total cost
5. Get user inputs under the following variables: city_flight, num_nights, rental_days
    - Use upper() function on city_flight input 
    - Turn num_nights and rental_days input into integers
