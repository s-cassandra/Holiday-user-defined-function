'''
Task: 
  1. Define a function that will calculate the area of a circle. Choose a name for the function and specify that it should take the radius as a 
  parameter.
  
  2. Inside the function, use the formula for calculating the area of a circle: Area = Ï€ * r^2.
  
  3. Implement a mechanism to get user input for the radius. Use the input function to prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle. Ensure 
  that you convert the input to a float to handle decimal values.
  
  4. Call the function you defined in step 3, passing the user-provided radius as an argument.
  
  5. Display the calculated area to the user. Use the print function to show the result. Format the output to show only two decimal places.
